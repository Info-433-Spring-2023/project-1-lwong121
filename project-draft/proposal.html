        <h1>Proposal - Video Game Tracker</h1>
    </header>

    <section>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            We want to do a video game collection tracker. This will be structured similarly to GoodReads. A user can
            put in video games, and it will be shown in a list. A user can keep track of how much time they played the
            game for, what they rate it, etc.
            Currently, it is difficult to figure out which game to purchase next, after finishing a game. This is
            because there are thousands of games that have been released. It is also difficult to remember which games
            have been played in the past given how long video games have been around.
        </p>

        <h2>Why a Video Game Collection Application?</h2>
        <p>
            Some issues we want to address with video games would be:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Interactions with friends who play video games</li>
            <li>Generally keeping track of games people play</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        A video game collection app would make it easier to share information about games with friends. This would also
        help people learn others' interests and helps them connect with them that way. Not only that, a video game
        collection app would keep users updated with what games they play. This is important to track statistics like
        the amount of time spent on one game. This could help users budget their time. In addition, users would be able
        to filter games they like, games of a certain genre, etc.
        </p>

        <h2>What are some existing solutions to these issues?</h2>
        <p>We identified 2 other websites that attempt to solve these issues:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The <a href="https://ggapp.io/" target="_blank">GG App Video Game Tracker</a> has similar functionality to what we are expecting. However, we also want to keep track of the amount of time we spend playing these video games. Keeping track of how much time we spend on a video game could help us budget our time better.
            </li>
            <li>
                We noticed that the <a href="https://www.grouvee.com/" target="_blank">Grouvee</a> website has a section where you can see what games your friends reviewed and what they rate it. However, we want to add further functionality such as DMs and  comments on reviews. This would allow people to connect further with our application and with each other.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Who will be using the website?</h2>
        <p>
            People who play video games and want a simple way to keep track of the games that they have played, want to play, and are currently playing. These users may also want to communicate and connect with other fellow gamers and friends to share their recommendations and reviews.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>What data will the users be looking at?</h2>
        <p>
            Users would be viewing video game information. We will be using <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/nikdavis/steam-store-games" target="_blank">Steam datasets</a> from Kaggle that contains data on videogames including the name, release date, developer, and descriptions. In particular, will use the 2 csv files: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/nikdavis/steam-store-games?select=steam.csv" target="_blank">stream.csv</a> and <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/nikdavis/steam-store-games?select=steam_description_data.csv" target="_blank">stream_description_data.csv</a>.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2> What will the users do with the web app? </h2>
        <p>
            Users will track the games that they have played, want to play,
            and are currently playing. They can also record their reviews,
            ratings, and amount of time spent playing the game. The app will
            also allow users to communicate with one another through DMs and comments.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2> How will using this app help to solve the chosen problem? </h2>
        <p>
          Using this app would allow users to track the time they spend playing
           each video game while also giving them a visual layout of which genres
            and types of games they enjoy, and which they do not.
            This application would also allow users to communicate interests
            with friends and strangers alike.
          </p>
          <p>
            The app solves both of the problems from question 1, as the organization tool
            can clearly show which games the user has played before, and the time tracker,
            and large video game library can make it easier to choose new games to play,
            as users can instantly see how much time they put into games,
            indicating how much they enjoyed them.
